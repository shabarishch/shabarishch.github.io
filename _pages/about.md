I am a PhD student in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, advised by [Mark Rudelson](https://websites.umich.edu/~rudelson/) and [Michał Derezi´ nski](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~derezin/). My research interests are in probability, random matrix theory and their applications to (randomized) numerical linear algebra. My recent works have been about using random matrix theory to obtain guarantees for matrix sketching, a dimension reduction procedure in the field of randomized numerical linear algebra. Currently I am working on other related dimension reduction problems.
