I am a PhD student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, advised by [Mark Rudelson](https://websites.umich.edu/~rudelson/). My research interests are in probability and random matrix theory. My recent works have been about using random matrix theory to obtain guarantees for matrix sketching, a dimension reduction procedure in the field of randomized numerical linear algebra. Currently I am working on other related dimension reduction problems.
