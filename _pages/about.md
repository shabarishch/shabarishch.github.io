I am a PhD student at the University of Michigan, advised by Mark Rudelson. My research interests are in probability and random matrix theory. My recent works have been about using random matrix theory to obtain guarantees for matrix sketching, a dimension reduction procedure in the field of randomized numerical linear algebra. Currently I am working on other related dimension reduction problems.
